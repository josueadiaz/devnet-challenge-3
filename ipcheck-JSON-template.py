You may or may not want to use the ipaddress library
but you will still need to check for a valid IPv4 adddress.

The 'with open('JSONdata') as f:' line will read the data file

from the json library to change the JSON text into something 
you can call from Python

#import ipaddress
import json

with open('JSONdata') as f:
#    data = json.
